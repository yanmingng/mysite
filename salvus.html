                <h2>The Project</h2>
                <p>Leverage a modern technology to address a real-world societal problem. <br><br>
                    Team Dynamics:<br>
                    🚀 A diverse, multi-disciplinary team spanning Computer Engineering, Environmental Engineering, English Humanities, and Business Marketing.<br><br>
                    What We Delivered:<br>
                    📌 A visually compelling A3 poster that captured our research and solution.<br>
                    🎤 An oral presentation to effectively communicate our findings and impact. <br><br>
                    Timeline:<br>
                    One semester to research, ideate, and deliver a meaningful solution.

                <h2>The Process</h2>
                <p>Through extensive research, we discovered a growing issue on TikTok—the rise of malicious comments that contribute to anxiety, distress, body insecurity, and unhealthy habits. <br><br>
                    While TikTok has built-in comment control mechanisms, these come with limitations. <br><br>
                    Seeing the need for a proactive solution, our team leveraged Artificial Intelligence (AI) to develop Salvus—Latin for "safe." <br><br>
                </p>

                </figure>
                <p>
                    Salvus is an AI-powered content filter designed to detect and block harmful comments before they are posted, reducing exposure to negativity in the first place. <br><br>

                <h2>Final Product</h2>
                <p>🎨 A visually appealing design with clear and coherent flow that let visuals do the talking. <br>
                    ✅ No unnecessary details, just meaningful insights. <br>
                    🔤 A classy serif font for titles and subheadings, paired with an easy-to-read sans-serif for the main content. <br>
                    👀 A soft, eye-friendly color palette for a polished, professional look. <br>

                <h2>My Reflection</h2>
                <p>This project transformed how I view interdisciplinary collaboration, showing me the power of diverse perspectives in solving complex challenges. <br><br>
                    By combining expertise from different fields, we enhanced creativity and efficiency, leading to a significant improvement in our final deliverables and even an upgraded grade from our initial proposal. <br><br>
                    To enhance the foundation of our project, we could also have conducted primary research—such as expert interviews and potential user feedback. <br><br>
                    Nevertheless, these lessons will continue to guide me as I navigate the ever-evolving digital landscape. <br><br>
                    Most importantly, a huge shoutout to my teammates—Joanna, Pei Xuan, Wei Ze, and Ziyu—for their dedication, creativity, and collaboration. This project wouldn’t have been the same without them!</p>
